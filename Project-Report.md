## 1. Executive Summary

### Overview
This project involves developing a classic Tetris game using C++ and the Raylib graphics library. The game includes features such as grid-based gameplay, real-time rendering of falling blocks, next-block preview, and sound effects.

### Key Findings
The main accomplishments of this project include:
- Implementing core Tetris functionalities
- Applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
- Integrating sound effects for improved user experience

---

## 2. Introduction

### Background
Tetris is a timeless puzzle game. Recreating it in C++ allowed us to explore fundamental and advanced OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and modular design.

### Project Objectives
The goal was to build a functional and interactive Tetris game using OOP, real-time rendering, and sound integration.

---

## 3. Project Description

### Scope
The project includes:
- Game logic for block movement
- Collision detection
- Line clearing
- Scoring
- Next block preview
- Sound effects

> Note: Online multiplayer and persistent score recording were **not** implemented in this version.

### Technical Overview
- Developed using Microsoft Visual Studio
- Used Raylib for graphics and audio

---

## 4. Methodology

### Approach
The project was developed over several weeks with distributed responsibilities and collaborative coding sessions.

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Fabiha Siddiqui:** Game loop, grid, block creation, movement  
- **Alishba Amir:** Rotation, collision, row clearing, game-over logic  
- **Jitesh Kumar:** UI, scoring, next block preview, sound integration, Raylib setup  

---

## 5. Project Implementation

### Design and Structure
The game window displays:
- A 2D grid for gameplay
- A score tracker
- A section for the next block  
Color-coded blocks represent different Tetrimino shapes.

### Functionalities Developed
- Real-time block movement and rotation
- Line clearing and scoring
- Next block preview
- Sound effects for gameplay events

### Challenges Faced
- Setting up Raylib was initially difficult due to compatibility/configuration issues
- Scheduling group work was difficult due to overlapping course commitments

---

## 6. Results

### Project Outcomes
- A fully playable Tetris game
- Responsive interface with sound
- Demonstrated understanding of OOP in a practical application

---

## 7. Conclusion

### Summary of Findings
The project successfully met its goals by recreating Tetris using C++ and OOP principles.

### Final Remarks
This was a fun and educational experience. We plan to improve the game in the future by adding:
- Score saving
- Difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard)
